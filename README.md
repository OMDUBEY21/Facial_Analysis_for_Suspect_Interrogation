## Facial_Analysis_for_Suspect_Interrogation : Criminal investigator 

### Introduction:
Facial Analysis for Suspect Interrogation is a real-time machine learning-based application used for detecting suspects in each interrogation session with the help of computer vision.

### Problem statement:
To elicit confessions from criminal suspects, police officers employ a range of strategies. Law
enforcement observes a suspect’s verbal and non-verbal cues during an interrogation. The key
areas on which attention is concentrated during interrogation are facial expression and body
language. For law enforcement to assess whether the suspect is telling the truth or not, the
interrogation contains behavior-provoking questions. However, despite all of their training,
cops may still have some questions about whether a particular person has committed a crime
or not. Therefore, an emotion facial analysis algorithm might be of great help to officers in providing
them with a general impression of the suspect. During each interrogation, a camera will record
all of the suspect’s facial expressions. Using an algorithm, these expressions will be transformed
into a graphical representation, and the investigator will examine the most prevalent expressions
in this frame of the graph to reach a preliminary determination of whether the suspect is telling
the truth or not which will furthere generate a report of overall session investigation and helps the
investigator to conclude whether the suspect is criminal or not.
